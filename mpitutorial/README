Helpful Lectures:
cs267_mpi_saphir_2005.pdf
Was a lecture given in our class and seemed to be a very useful primer for 
writing in MPI

part1.pdf
An extra tutorial we found on the web with some useful slides, i would
look at this secondly, with more useful syntax and examples further along
in it
It shows pictures of different communication calls like ALLtoALL


part2.pdf
This part is not really necessary, but just in case you want to reference it
it has more advanced topics in it

And then www.mpi-forum.org has some lengthy documentation about all the
different MPI commands

Just some other things: All the talk about getting in deadlocks we don't 
have to worry about when using Collective communications, which is good.
We'll use MPI_allgather, instead of MPI_send and MPI_RECV because all 
the processors need the data and ALLgather combines send and recv into 1.

Also the difference between AllGather and AllGatherv is that in the second
case each processor can have a different number of molecules. 
I simplified my code to just use the first version so that the number 
of molecules has to be evenly divisible by the number of processors. 

For running on vita, so far the programs will compile, but the LAM/MPI
envirnment isn't setup yet, so you can't mpirun them, so i'll let you know
when that is set up
